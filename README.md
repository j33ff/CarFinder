Using google maps API and Facebook API
This project uses the elevation tracker of the google maps API to identify how far or below the user is above or below sea level. An elevation below sea level gives a recommendation to buy a submarine, with elevations gradually higher than sea level recommending vehicles more suited to offroading. Slighly above sea level gives a sportscar. Users can share their recommended vehicle on Facebook or click the link to purchase.
